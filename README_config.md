#### yarrsecrets.toml

The config `yarrsecrets.toml` are only useful if you want to hide the 
credentials for your services. It **does not** add security. If someone gets
access to your drive files they can easily decipher the secrets. It's only 
useful if you want to stream yourself developing Yarrosco's code, as it would
prevent accidental leak of keys.


The config `yarrosco.toml` contains all configuration options possible. Tune
them to your liking.
