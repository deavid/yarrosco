Logotype licensing (or lack of)
===============================

Yarrosco provides some logotypes to use for associating the messages with
the chat provider, as a convenience.

These logos EXCLUDED from the Apache license v2.0 in this repository. Logotypes
belong to their authors and their respective companies holding the trademarks.

Logotypes are protected usually by copyright and trademark, and even redrawing
them from scratch does not avoid trademark issues. Please don't include "free"
logotypes that someone redraw. Don't redraw them yourself. That doesn't avoid
licensing issues.

A logotype should not be altered in any form, and should be used to refer the
service or provider of each one. Changes in color, rotation, etc, might infringe
the trademark of the given company. Respect the original logos as much as
possible.

About endorsement: In all cases where these logos are displayed it MUST be 
entirely clear that these companies do not endorse Yarrosco. Using the logotypes
to associate a brand as endorsing a product orif it makes it look ilke the 
application is an official one from a given brand, it will cause problems.

Yarrosco will use these logos specifically to associate where the chats come 
from and (maybe) some other minor stuff to associate features to the relevant
chat provider that it's affecting.

When using these logos, please be very mindful of this.

Matrix logo
------------

We were unable to find any suitable logo that is in square form and highly 
readable in small sizes.

We found two logos which are unsuitable:
* https://matrix.org/images/matrix-logo.svg
* https://matrix.org/images/matrix-logo-white.svg

These are too wide for usage within Yarrosco and not readable enough so we'd 
prefer to use Element's logotype instead.
